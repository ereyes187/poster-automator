# music-poster-generator

This personal project was inspired by a set of album posters I created for my room using Canva. Itâ€™s a journey to challenge myself by learning new technologies while building something innovative and fun.

The goal of this project is to automate the creation of custom album posters. By leveraging the Spotify Web API to fetch album details such as the title, cover art, and tracklist, I can format this information into visually appealing and unique artworks.

Whether you're a music lover or simply appreciate creative design, this project aims to combine both.
